Hello! I'm Ashish, a passionate third-year IT student at NIT Kurukshetra with a keen interest in web development and problem-solving. As a fresher developer, I enjoy crafting custom solutions using React and Node.js. My projects range from e-commerce platforms and hotel booking apps to collaborative coding platforms, where I've implemented features like real-time communication with WebSockets, authentication with JWT/OAuth2, and user-friendly UI with Material UI and Ant Design.

I am also actively involved in hackathons, having represented my college in the Smart India Hackathon and achieved a top-7 ranking in the Excalibur Hackathon. Driven by a goal to establish my own product-based firm, I continually seek opportunities to work on real-world applications and enhance my skills.

Core Skills: JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node.js, MongoDB, WebRTC, WebSockets, CSS (Module CSS, Ant Design, Material UI)

Current Focus: Building a collaborative coding platform with live code sharing and a whiteboard feature for real-time user interaction.
